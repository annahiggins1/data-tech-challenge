My process was overall very exploratory. I didn't find too much to clean --  When going through the data, I tried to focus on different areas at a time to better understand AeroConnect's business model, for example focusing on overall routes, geographic regions, seasonal changes, and inbound/outbound traffic.
For model selection, I tried to think through what would be the best models based on prior knowledge from class. I implemented a lot of them [see model/data_model_testing.ipynb] including linear regression (and some variances on this including lasso/ridge/elastic net), polynomial regression, decision tree, and random forest regression. Random forest regression ended up being the most optimal based on two key metrics: MSE and R^2. I formalized the model and put it in data_model_final. The accuracy probably would have benefitted from more data points.
